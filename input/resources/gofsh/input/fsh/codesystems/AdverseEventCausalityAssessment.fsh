* #unlikely "Unlikely" "i) Event or laboratory test abnormality, with a time to drug intake that makes a relationship improbable (but not impossible); or ii) Disease or other drugs provide plausible explanations."

* #unassessable-unclassifiable "Unassessable/Unclassifiable" "i) Report suggesting an adverse reaction; ii) Cannot be judged because information is insufficient or contradictory; or iii) Data cannot be supplemented or verified."
