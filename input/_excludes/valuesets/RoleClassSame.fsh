Title: "RoleClassSame"
Description: """The "same" roleclass asserts an identity between playing and scoping entities: that they are in fact instances of the same entity and, in the case of discrepancies (e.g different DOB, gender), that one or both are in error.

*Usage:*

playing and scoping entities must have same classcode, but need not have identical attributes or values.

*Example:* 

a provider registry maintains sets of conflicting demographic data for what is reported to be the same individual."""
