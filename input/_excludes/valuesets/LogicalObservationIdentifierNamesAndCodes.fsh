Title: "LogicalObservationIdentifierNamesAndCodes"
Description: "The LOINC database provides a set of universal names and ID codes for identifying laboratory and clinical test results. The purpose is to facilitate the exchange and pooling of results, such as blood hemoglobin, serum potassium, or vital signs, for clinical care, outcomes management, and research. The LOINC codes are not intended to transmit all possible information about a test or observation. They are only intended to identify the test result or clinical observation. http://www.regenstrief.org/LOINC/LOINC.htm"
