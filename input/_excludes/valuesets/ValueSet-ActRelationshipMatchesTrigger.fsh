Title: "ActRelationshipMatchesTrigger"
Description: "A trigger-match links an actual service (e.g., an observation or procedure that took place) with a service in criterion mood. For example if the trigger is \"observation of pain\" and pain is actually observed, and if that pain-observation caused the trigger to fire, that pain-observation can be linked with the trigger."
