Title: "ParticipationInformationRecipient"
Description: "A party, who may or should receive or who has recieved the Act or subsequent or derivative information of that Act. Information recipient is inert, i.e., independent of mood.\" Rationale: this is a generalization of a too diverse family that the definition can't be any more specific, and the concept is abstract so one of the specializations should be used."
