Title: "RoleClassPolicyHolder"
Description: """A role played by a person or organization that holds an insurance policy. The underwriter of that policy is the scoping entity.

*Discussion:*The identifier of the policy is captured in 'Role.id' when the Role is a policy holder.

A particular policy may cover several individuals one of whom may be, but need not be, the policy holder. Thus the notion of covered party is a role that is distinct from that of the policy holder."""
