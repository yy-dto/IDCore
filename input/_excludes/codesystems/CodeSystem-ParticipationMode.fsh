Id: v3-ParticipationMode
Title: "ParticipationMode"
Description: """A set of codes specifying the modality by which the Entity playing the Role is participating in the Act.

*Examples:* Physically present, over the telephone, written communication.

*Rationale:* Particularly for author (originator) participants this is used to specify whether the information represented by the act was initially provided verbally, (hand-)written, or electronically.

*Open Issue:* There needs to be a reexamination of the hierarchies as there seems to be some muddling between ELECTRONIC and other concepts that involve electronic communication that are in other hierarchies."""
