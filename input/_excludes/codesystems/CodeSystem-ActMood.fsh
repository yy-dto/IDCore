Title: "ActMood"
Description: "OpenIssue: In Ballot 2009May, a strong Negative vote was lodged against several of the concept definitions in the vocabulary used for Act.moodCode. The vote was found \"Persuasive With Mod\", with the understanding that M and M would undertake a detailed review of these concept definitions for a future release of the RIM."
