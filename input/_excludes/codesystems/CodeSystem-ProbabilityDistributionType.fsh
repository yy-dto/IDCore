The log-normal distribution can be specified with the properties mean m and standard deviation s. Note however that mean m and standard deviation s are the parameters of the raw value distribution, not the transformed parameters of the lognormal distribution that are conventionally referred to by the same letters. Those log-normal parameters mlog and slog relate to the mean m and standard deviation s of the data value through slog2 = log (s2/m2 + 1) and mlog = log m - slog2/2."

Because of the central limit theorem, the normal distribution is the distribution of choice for an unbounded random variable that is an outcome of a combination of many stochastic processes. Even for values bounded on a single side (i.e. greater than 0) the normal distribution may be accurate enough if the mean is \"far away\" from the bound of the scale measured in terms of standard deviations."

The width of this interval is 2s sqrt(3).

The only parameter of the c2-distribution is n, so called the number of degrees of freedom (which is the number of independent parts in the sum). The c2-distribution is a special type of g-distribution with parameter a = n /2 and b = 2. Hence, m = n and s2 = 2 n."
