Title: "Medication Reference Terminology (MED-RT)"
Description: """Medication Reference Terminology (MED-RT) is the evolutionary successor to the Veterans Health Administration National Drug File â€“ Reference Terminology (VHA NDF-RT). Both are formal ontology representations of medication terminology, pharmacologic classifications, and asserted authoritative relationships between them.

The MED-RT code system includes relationships between MED-RT concepts and concepts in external code systems, as well as relationships between concepts only in the external code systems. The external code systems that MED-RT references include RxNorm, MeSH, and SNOMED CT US Edition.

MED-RT can be downloaded from https://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/MED-RT/
