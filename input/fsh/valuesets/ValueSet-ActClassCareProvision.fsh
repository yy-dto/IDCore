 *  to take responsibility for a scope specified by the code attribute,
 *  for an entity (linked as a **participant** of type **subject** (SBJ)).

The scope of the care for which responsibility is taken is identified by *code* attribute.

In **event** (EVN) mood **care provision** indicates the effective time interval of a specified scope of responsibility by a **performer** (PRF) or set of **performers** (PRF) for a **subject** (SBJ).

*Examples:*

1.  Referral from GP to a specialist.
2.  Assignment of a patient or group of patients to the case list of a health professional.
