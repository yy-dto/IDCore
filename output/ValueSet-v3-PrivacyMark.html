Such markings must be displayed as directed by applicable policy on electronically rendered information content and any electronic transmittal envelope or container; or on hardcopy information and any physical transmittal envelope or container.</p>
<p>Examples of protocols for marking displays on electronic or hardcopy rendered content: Across the top or &quot;banner&quot; of each page ; as a watermark placed diagonally cross each page; at the bottom or &quot;footer&quot; of each page; and may be displayed at the beginning of any portion within the content that required markings different than other portions of the content. The banner or top of page marking typically acts as a &quot;high watermark&quot; by including all of the markings made on any marked portions within the entirety of the information content.</p>
<p><em>Usage Note:</em> A &quot;Privacy Mark&quot; is a Security Control Observation (SECCONOBS) named tag set as specified by the HL7 Privacy and Security Classification System (HCS). A Privacy Mark Named Tag Set is valued with a Privacy Mark leaf code &quot;tag&quot;, which is a member of the Security Control Observation Value (_SecurityObservationValue) tag set. Related Security Control Observation named tag sets are Purpose of Use, Obligation Policy, and Refrain Policy, each with their own Security Control Observation Value tag sets.</p>
<p>Foundational standard definitions: ISO 22600-3 Section A.3.4.3 - If present, the privacy-mark is not used for access control. The content of the privacy-mark may be defined by the security policy in force (identified by the security-policy-identifier) which may define a list of values to be used. Alternately, the value may be determined by the originator of the security-label. IEEE Security Glossary Compendium 93- CESG Memorandum No.1 Issue 1.2 Oct 1992 - Human readable word or phrase acting as an indicator of all or part of the security constraints that apply to a document so marked. NOTE: A machine readable representation of a marking.</p>
<p><em>Comment:</em> While policies requiring creators, processors, custodians, senders or recipients apply, enforce, and persist applicable Privacy Marks may be dictated by a jurisdiction, organization or personal privacy, security, or integrity policy, those required to comply may be governed under different policies, so compliance may need to be enforced through trust contracts. For example, information content marked with GDPR related policies may require adherence by processors or recipients outside of the European Union. For this reason, this code system is likely to evolve with the inclusion of multiple policy domains needing to communicate encoded policies in a standard, interoperable manner.</p>

Law, regulation, or Government-wide policy may require or permit safeguarding or dissemination controls in three ways: Requiring or permitting agencies to control or protect the information but providing no specific controls, which makes the information CUI Basic; requiring or permitting agencies to control or protect the information and providing specific controls for doing so, which makes the information CUI Specified; or requiring or permitting agencies to control the information and specifying only some of those controls, which makes the information CUI Specified, but with CUI Basic controls where the authority does not specify.

<p><em>Usage Note:</em> Regulatory Source: 32 CFR §  2002.20 Marking. Federal Register Page 63344 63344 (ii) Authorized holders permitted to designate CUI must portion mark both CUI and uncontrolled unclassified portions.</p>
<p>CUI Marking Handbook https://www.archives.gov/files/cui/20161206-cui-marking-handbook-v1-1.pdf</p>
<p>CUI Portion Marking: Portion marking of CUI is optional in a fully unclassified document, but is permitted and encouraged to facilitate information sharing and proper handling of the information. Agency heads may approve the required use of CUI Portion marking on all CUI generated within their agency. As such, users should consult their agency CUI policy when creating CUI documents. When CUI Portion Markings are used and a portion does not contain CUI a &quot;U&quot; is placed in parentheses to indicate that the portion contains Uncontrolled Unclassified Information. (Page 14)</p>
<p>CUI Portion Markings are placed at the beginning of the portion to which they apply and must be used throughout the entire document. They are presented in all capital letters and separated as indicated in this handbook and the CUI Registry. The presence of EVEN ONE item of CUI in a document requires CUI marking of that document. Because of this, CUI Portion Markings can be of great assistance in determining if a document contains CUI and therefore must be marked as such. Remember: When portion markings are used and any portion does not contain CUI, a &quot;(U)&quot; is placed in front of that portion to indicate that it contains Uncontrolled - or non-CUI - Unclassified Information.

<p><em>Usage Note:</em> Confidentiality codes may be used in security labels and privacy markings to classify IT resources based on sensitivity to indicate the obligation of a custodian or receiver to ensure that the protected resource is not made available or disclosed to individuals, entities, or processes (security principals) unless authorized per applicable policies. Confidentiality codes may also be used in the clearances of initiators requesting access to protected resources.</p>

For example, in order to warn a recipient of 42 CFR Part 2 information of the redisclosure restrictions, the rule mandates that end users receive a written prohibition against redisclosure unless authorized by patient consent or otherwise permitted by Part 2. See 42 CFR §  2.32 Prohibition on re-disclosure. (a)Notice to accompany disclosure. Each disclosure made with the patient's written consent must be accompanied by one of the following written statements: (1) This information has been disclosed to you from records protected by federal confidentiality rules ( 42 CFR part 2). The federal rules prohibit you from making any further disclosure of information in this record that identifies a patient as having or having had a substance use disorder either directly, by reference to publicly available information, or through verification of such identification by another person unless further disclosure is expressly permitted by the written consent of the individual whose information is being disclosed or as otherwise permitted by 42 CFR part 2. A general authorization for the release of medical or other information is NOT sufficient for this purpose (see §  2.31). The federal rules restrict any use of the information to investigate or prosecute with regard to a crime any patient with a substance use disorder, except as provided at § §  2.12(c)(5) and 2.65; or (2) 42 CFR part 2 prohibits unauthorized disclosure of these records. https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/42/2.32</p>
<p><em>Usage Note:</em> Example of marking requirement from SAMHSA FAQ Response to question 13:</p>
<p>Would a logon or splash page notification on an HIO's portal that contains the Part 2 notice prohibiting redisclosure be sufficient to meet Part 2's requirement that disclosures made with patient consent be accompanied by such a statement?</p>
<p>No. Part 2 requires each disclosure made with written patient consent to be accompanied by a written statement that the information disclosed is protected by federal law and that the recipient cannot make any further disclosure of it unless permitted by the regulations (42 CFR §  2.32). A logon page is the page where a user logs onto a computer system; a splash page is an introductory page to a web site. A logon or splash page notification on a HIO's portal including the statement as required by §  2.32 would not be sufficient notification regarding prohibitions on redisclosure since it would not accompany a specific disclosure. The notification must be tied to the Part 2 information being disclosed in order to ensure that the recipient of that information knows that specific information is protected by Part 2 and cannot be redisclosed except as authorized by the express written consent of the person to whom it pertains or as otherwise permitted by Part 2. https://www.samhsa.gov/about-us/who-we-are/laws-regulations/confidentiality-regulations-faqs</p>

<p><em>Usage Note:</em> The definition is based on HL7 Confidentiality code &quot;R&quot; (restricted), which is described as:</p>
<p>Privacy metadata indicating highly sensitive, potentially stigmatizing information, which presents a high risk to the information subject if disclosed without authorization. May be pre-empted by jurisdictional law, e.g., for public health reporting or emergency treatment. Foundational definitions of Confidentiality: From HL7 Confidentiality Concept Domain: Types of privacy metadata classifying an IT resource (data, information object, service, or system capability) according to its level of sensitivity, which is based on an analysis of applicable privacy policies and the risk of financial, reputational, or other harm to an individual or entity that could result if made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes.</p>
<p>Usage Note from HL7 Confidentiality code &quot;R&quot;: Confidentiality codes may be used in security labels and privacy markings to classify IT resources based on sensitivity to indicate the obligation of a custodian or receiver to ensure that the protected resource is not made available or disclosed to individuals, entities, or processes (security principals) unless authorized per applicable policies. Confidentiality codes may also be used in the clearances of initiators requesting access to protected resources.</p>
<p>This metadata indicates that the receiver may be obligated to comply with applicable, prevailing (default) jurisdictional privacy law or disclosure authorization.</p>
<p>Map: Definition aligns with ISO 7498-2:1989 - Confidentiality is the property that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes. Map: Partial Map to ISO 13606-4 Sensitivity Level (3) Clinical Care: Default for normal clinical care access (i.e. most clinical staff directly caring for the patient should be able to access nearly all of the EHR).
