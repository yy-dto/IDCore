  fhir:description [ fhir:v "The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides a central location for voluntary submission of genetic test information by providers. The scope includes the test's purpose, methodology, validity, evidence of the test's usefulness, and laboratory contacts and credentials. The overarching goal of the GTR is to advance the public health and research into the genetic basis of health and disease.\r\n\r\nEach Test is a specific, orderable test from a particular laboratory, and is assigned a unique GTR accession number. The format is GTR00000001.1, with a leading prefix \"GTR\" followed by 8 digits, a period, then 1 or more digits representing the version. When a laboratory updates a registered test, a new version number is assigned.\r\n\r\nTo find all laboratories in GTR and all registered tests, see here https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/all/tests/?term=all%5Bsb%5D"] ; #
