Numerous sources for disease definitions and data models currently exist, which include HPO, OMIM, SNOMED CT, ICD, PhenoDB, MedDRA, MedGen, ORDO, DO, GARD, etc; however, these sources partially overlap and sometimes conflict, making it difficult to know definitively how they relate to each other. This has resulted in a proliferation of mappings between disease entries in different resources; however mappings are problematic: collectively, they are expensive to create and maintain. Most importantly, the mappings lack completeness, accuracy, and precision; as a result, mapping calls are often inconsistent between resources. The UMLS provides intermediate concepts through which other resources can be mapped, but these mappings suffer from the same challenges: they are not guaranteed to be one-to-one, especially in areas with evolving disease concepts such as rare disease.    In order to address the lack of a unified disease terminology that provides precise equivalences between disease concepts, we created Mondo, which provides a logic-based structure for unifying multiple disease resources.    Mondo’s development is coordinated with the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), which describes the individual phenotypic features that constitute a disease. Like the HPO, Mondo provides a hierarchical structure which can be used for classification or “rolling up” diseases to higher level groupings. It provides mappings to other disease resources, but in contrast to other mappings between ontologies, we precisely annotate each mapping using strict semantics, so that we know when two disease names or identifiers are equivalent or one-to-one, in contrast to simply being closely related.

CDPS uses International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes to assign CDPS Categories that indicate illness burden related to major body systems (e.g. cardiovascular) or types of chronic disease (e.g. diabetes). Within each major category is a hierarchy reflecting both the clinical severity of the condition and its expected effect on future costs. Each of the hierarchical CDPS Categories is assigned a CDPS weight. CDPS weights are additive across major categories.""    ""The CDPS model was developed in 2000 using data from seven Fee-for-Service (FFS) Medicaid programs.  The model received major updates in 2009 (using national FFS Medicaid data from 2002-2005) and in 2014 (using additional national FFS Medicaid data from 2011). CDPS has also received regular annual updates to include the most recent ICD and NDC codes.""

With these common categories, we, as service providers, navigators, and people in need, can find human services quickly and easily.""    ""The Open Eligibility taxonomy consists of two important concepts: Human Services and Human Situations.    Human Services are services offered by government or charitable organizations, and include things such as housing, food pantries or counseling services.    Human Situations are ways of describing attributes of a person that could help them find programs they are looking for, including examples like: veterans, physical disability or seniors.""

Created with the passage of the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003, the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug benefit became the second major Medicare capitated payment system. CMS developed the Part D RxHCC risk adjustment model to apply to monthly capitated payments to both Medicare Advantage (MA-PDs) and standalone prescription drug plans (PDPs). The Part D RxHCC risk adjustment model implemented in 2006 was developed using a structure similar to the CMS-HCC model, in that it included demographic and diagnosis information clustered into hierarchical condition categories. CMS obtains diagnoses for all Medicare beneficiaries from either fee-for-service claims or Medicare Advantage reporting. In 2011, CMS implemented an updated Part D RxHCC risk adjustment model, incorporating program data derived from prescription drug event (PDE) data. The data used to calibrate this updated model was more recent cost and utilization data, resulting in a model that reflects more recent drug cost and utilization patterns.

Annex A specifies the methodology for and structure of the RDD Dictionary, and specifies how further Terms may be defined under the governance of a Registration Authority, requirements for which are described in Annex C.    Taken together, these specifications and the RDD Dictionary and Database make up the RDD System. Use of the RDD System will facilitate the accurate exchange and processing of information between interested parties involved in the administration of rights in, and use of, Digital Items, and in particular it is intended to support ISO/IEC 21000-5 (REL). Clause 6 describes how ISO/IEC 21000-6:2004 relates to ISO/IEC 21000-5.    As well as providing definitions of terms for use in ISO/IEC 21000-5, the RDD System is designed to support the mapping of terms from different namespaces. Such mapping will enable the transformation of metadata from the terminology of one namespace (or Authority) into that of another namespace. Mapping, to ensure minimum ambiguity or loss of semantic integrity, will be the responsibility of the Registration Authority. Provision of automated trm look-up is also a requirement.    The RDD Dictionary is a prescriptive dctionary, in the sense that it defines a single meaning for a trm represented by a particular RddAuthorized TermName, but it is also inclusive in that it can recognize the prescription of other Headwords and definitions by other Authorities and incorporates them through mappings. The RDD Dictionary also supports the circumstance that the same name may have different meanings under different Authorities. ISO/IEC 21000-6:2004describes audit provisions so that additions, amendments and deletions to Terms and their attributes can be tracked.    ISO/IEC 21000-6:2004 recognizes legal definitions as and only as Terms from other Authorities that can be mapped into the RDD Dictionary.

The alpha-2 code was devised for practical use for most of the major languages of the world that are not only most frequently represented in the total body of the world's literature, but which also comprise a considerable volume of specialized languages and terminologies. Additional language identifiers are created when it becomes apparent that a significant body of documentation written in specialized languages and terminologies exists.

An action plan is a composite Act with component Acts. In a sequential plan, each component has a sequenceNumber that specifies the ordering of the plan steps. Before each step is executed and has preconditions these conditions are tested and if the test is positive, the Act has clearance for execution. The repeatNumber may indicate that an Act may be repeatedly executed. The checkpointCode is specifies when the precondition is checked and is analogous to the various conditional statements and loop constructs in programming languages ""while-do"" vs. ""do-while"" or ""repeat-until"" vs. ""loop-exit"".    For all checkpointCodes, except ""end"", preconditions are being checked at the time when the preceding step of the plan has terminated and this step would be next in the sequence established by the sequenceNumber attribute.    When the checkpointCode for a criterion of a repeatable Act is ""end"", the criterion is tested only at the end of each repetition of that Act. When the condition holds true, the next repetition is ready for execution.    When the checkpointCode is ""entry"" the criterion is checked at the beginning of each repetition (if any) whereas ""beginning"" means the criterion is checked only once before the repetition ""loop"" starts.    The checkpointCode ""through"" is special in that it requires the condition to hold throughout the execution of the Act, even throughout a single execution. As soon as the condition turns false, the Act should receive an interrupt event (see interruptibleInd) and will eventually terminate.    The checkpointCode ""exit"" is only used on a special plan step that represents a loop exit step. This allows an action plan to exit due to a condition tested inside the execution of this plan.

Branches exist when multiple components have the same sequenceNumber. Branches are parallel if the splitCode specifies that more than one branch can be executed at the same time. The joinCode then specifies if and how the braches are resynchronized.    The principal re-synchronization actions are (1) the control flow waits for a branch to terminate (wait-branch), (2) the branch that is not yet terminated is aborted (kill-branch), (3) the branch is not re-synchronized at all and continues in parallel (detached branch).    A kill branch is only executed if there is at least one active wait (or exclusive wait) branch. If there is no other wait branch active, a kill branch is not started at all (rather than being aborted shortly after it is started.)

In addition to exlusive and inclusive split the splitCode specifies how the pre-condition (also known as ""guard conditions"" on the branch) are evaluated. A guard condition may be evaluated once when the branching step is entered and if the conditions do not hold at that time, the branch is abandoned. Conversely execution of a branch may wait until the guard condition turns true.

The standards define a Hispanic or Latino as a person of ""Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, South or Central America, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race.""

Instead, the federal standards acknowledge that race is a social-political construct in which an individual's own identification with one more race categories is preferred to observer identification. The standards use a variety of features to define five minimum race categories. Among these features are descent from ""the original peoples"" of a specified region or nation.

The legislation included a requirement that the New York State Department of Health (NYDH) evaluate the applicability of the DRGs to a non-Medicare population. In particular, the legislation required that the DRGs be evaluated with respect to neonates and patients with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infections. NYDH entered into an agreement with 3M HIS to assist with the evaluation of the need for DRG modifications as well as to make the necessary changes in the DRG definitions and software. The DRG definitions developed by NYDH and 3M HIS are referred to as the All Patient DRGs (AP DRGs).",
http://uri.hddaccess.com/cs/aprdrg,0.1.0,active,,APRDRG,All Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Groups (APR DRGs),"3M APR DRGs have become the standard across the U.S. for classifying hospital inpatients in non-Medicare populations. As of January 2019, 27 state Medicaid programs use 3M APR DRGs to pay hospitals, as do approximately a dozen commercial payers and Medicaid managed care organizations. Over 2,400 hospitals have licensed 3M APR DRGs to verify payment and analyze their internal operations.    The 3M APR DRG methodology classifies hospital inpatients according to their reason for admission, severity of illness and risk of mortality.    Each year 3M calculates and releases a set of statistics for each 3M APR DRG based on our analysis of large national data sets. These statistics include a relative weight for each 3M APR DRG. The relative weight reflects the average hospital resource use for a patient in that 3M APR DRG relative to the average hospital resource use of all inpatients. Please note that payers and other users of the 3M APR DRG methodology are responsible for ensuring that they use relative weights that are appropriate for their particular populations. The 3M APR DRG statistics also include data for each 3M APR DRG on relative frequency, average length of stay, average charges and incidence of mortality.    3M APR DRGs can be rolled up into broader categories.

CPT coding is also used for administrative management purposes such as claims processing and developing guidelines for medical care review. Each year, via a rigorous, evidence-based and transparent process, the independent CPT Editorial Panel revises, creates or deletes hundreds of codes in order to reflect current medical practice.    Designated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) as a national coding set for physician and other health care professional services and procedures, CPT’s evidence-based codes accurately encompass the full range of health care services.    All CPT codes are five-digits and can be either numeric or alphanumeric, depending on the category. CPT code descriptors are clinically focused and utilize common standards so that a diverse set of users can have common understanding across the clinical health care paradigm.    There are various types of CPT codes:    Category I: These codes have descriptors that correspond to a procedure or service. Codes range from 00100–99499 and are generally ordered into sub-categories based on procedure/service type and anatomy.    Category II: These alphanumeric tracking codes are supplemental codes used for performance measurement. Using them is optional and not required for correct coding.    Category III: These are temporary alphanumeric codes for new and developing technology, procedures and services. They were created for data collection, assessment and in some instances, payment of new services and procedures that currently don’t meet the criteria for a Category I code.

ClinVar thus facilitates access to and communication about the relationships asserted between human variation and observed health status, and the history of that interpretation. ClinVar processes submissions reporting variants found in patient samples, assertions made regarding their clinical significance, information about the submitter, and other supporting data. The alleles described in submissions are mapped to reference sequences, and reported according to the HGVS standard. ClinVar then presents the data for interactive users as well as those wishing to use ClinVar in daily workflows and other local applications. ClinVar works in collaboration with interested organizations to meet the needs of the medical genetics community as efficiently and effectively as possible. Read more about using ClinVar.    ClinVar supports submissions of differing levels of complexity. The submission may be as simple as a representation of an allele and its interpretation (sometimes termed a variant-level submission), or as detailed as providing multiple types of structured observational (case-level) or experimental evidence about the effect of the variation on phenotype. A major goal is to support computational (re)evaluation, both of genotypes and assertions, and to enable the ongoing evolution and development of knowledge regarding variations and associated phenotypes. ClinVar is an active partner of the ClinGen project, providing data for evaluation and archiving the results of interpretation by recognized expert panels and providers of practice guidelines (see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/review_guidelines/). ClinVar archives and versions submissions which means that when submitters update their records, the previous version is retained for review. Read more about submitting data to ClinVar at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/submit.     The level of confidence in the accuracy of variation calls and assertions of clinical significance depends in large part on the supporting evidence, so this information, when available, is collected and visible to users. Because the availability of supporting evidence may vary, particularly in regard to retrospective data aggregated from published literature, the archive accepts submissions from multiple groups, and aggregates related information, to reflect transparently both consensus and conflicting assertions of clinical significance. A review status is also assigned to any assertion, to support communication about the trustworthiness of any assertion. Domain experts are encouraged to apply for recognition as an expert panel (more info at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/review_guidelines/).     Accessions, with the format SCV000000000.0, are assigned to each submitted record. If there are multiple submitted records about the same variation/condition pair, they are aggregated within ClinVar's data flow and reported as a reference accession with the format RCV000000000.0. Because of this model, one variant will be included in multiple RCV accessions whenever different conditions are reported for that variant. Submitted records for the same variation are also aggregated and reported as an accession with the format VCV000000000.0. This aggregation lets a user review all submitted data for a variant, regardless of the condition for which it was interpreted.    ClinVar archives submitted information, and adds identifiers and other data that may be available about a variant or condition from other public resources. However ClinVar neither curates content nor modifies interpretations independent of an explicit submission. If you have data that differs from what is currently represented in ClinVar, we encourage you to submit your data and the evidence supporting your interpretation. There is a submission wizard to guide you through that process. See https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/variation/clinvar_single_wizard/.

Therefore, under the IPPS, we[CMS] pay for inpatient hospital services on a rate per discharge basis that varies according to the DRG to which a beneficiary's stay is assigned. The formula used to calculate payment for a specific case multiplies an individual hospital's payment rate per case by the weight of the DRG to which the case is assigned.  Each DRG weight represents the average resources required to care for cases in that particular DRG, relative to the average resources used to treat cases in all DRGs. Congress recognized that it would be necessary to recalculate the DRG relative weights periodically to account for changes in resource consumption.  Accordingly, section 1886(d)(4)(C) of the Act requires that the Secretary adjust the DRG classifications and relative weights at least annually.  These adjustments are made to reflect changes in treatment patterns, technology, and any other factors that may change the relative use of hospital resources.    Currently, cases are classified into Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groups (MS-DRGs) for payment under the IPPS based on the following information reported by the hospital: the principal diagnosis, up to 25 additional diagnoses, and up to 25 procedures performed during the stay.  In a small number of MS-DRGs, classification is also based on the age, sex, and discharge status of the patient.  Effective October 1, 2015, the diagnosis and procedure information is reported by the hospital using codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) and the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS).    Content can be obtained on the CMS hosted page located at https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/AcuteInpatientPPS/MS-DRG-Classifications-and-Software     The DRGs are released annually with errata published infrequently. The fiscal year and release version should be noted (e.g., 2021.38.R1).    Requests for annual MS-DRG classification changes and any MS-DRG related inquiries should be sent to the MSDRGClassificationChange@cms.hhs.gov mailbox.

Case-mix groups are developed based on research into utilization patterns among various provider types. For the payment systems that use HIPPS codes, clinical assessment data is the basic input. A standard patient assessment instrument is interpreted by case-mix grouping software algorithms, which assign the case mix group. For payment purposes, at least one HIPPS code is defined to represent each case-mix group. These HIPPS codes are reported on claims to insurers.    Institutional providers use HIPPS codes on claims in association with special revenue codes. One revenue code is defined for each prospective payment system that requires HIPPS codes. HIPPS codes are placed in data element SV202 on the electronic 837 institutional claims transaction, using an HP qualifier, or in Form Locator (FL) 44 (""HCPCS/rate"") on a paper UB-04 claims form. The associated revenue code is placed in data element SV201 or in FL 42. In certain circumstances, multiple HIPPS codes may appear on separate lines of a single claim.""    ""HIPPS codes are alpha-numeric codes of five digits. Each code contains intelligence, with certain positions of the code indicating the case mix group itself, and other positions providing additional information. The additional information varies among HIPPS codes pertaining to different payment systems, but often provides information about the clinical assessment used to arrive at the code. Which positions of the code carry the case mix group information may also vary by payment systems.""    ""Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) rules for transactions and code sets, HIPPS codes are defined as a non-medical code set. Therefore, these codes are effective by transaction date.    Effective From Dates: HIPPS codes are valid under HIPAA on transactions on or after this date. Since all HIPPS codes to date have been initially created for Original Medicare payment systems, this is also date of service the codes begin to be payable by Medicare. While it is valid under HIPAA rules that a claim for dates of service before this date could be submitted on a transaction after this date, CMS is not aware of a business need for a provider to do so. The code would not be payable by any insurer and no Grouper software would be available to produce a code for those dates.    Effective Through Dates: HIPPS codes are no longer valid under HIPAA on transactions on or after this date. This date may vary from the date a code ceases to be payable by Medicare, since other payers may continue to use older HIPPS codes after Medicare transitions to a new payment system. Since CMS, as the HIPPS code set maintainer, may not have complete information about other payers’ uses of these codes, codes may remain effective under HIPAA long after they cease to be payable on Medicare claims. To reflect this, a separate column on the HIPPS Code Master List indicates the Medicare Payment Though Date.""",
