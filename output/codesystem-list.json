      "description" : "The Mondo Disease Ontology is a semi-automatically constructed ontology that merges in multiple disease resources to yield a coherent merged ontology that contains cross-species disease terminology.\r\n\r\nNumerous sources for disease definitions and data models currently exist, which include HPO, OMIM, SNOMED CT, ICD, PhenoDB, MedDRA, MedGen, ORDO, DO, GARD, etc; however, these sources partially overlap and sometimes conflict, making it difficult to know definitively how they relate to each other. This has resulted in a proliferation of mappings between disease entries in different resources; however mappings are problematic: collectively, they are expensive to create and maintain. Most importantly, the mappings lack completeness, accuracy, and precision; as a result, mapping calls are often inconsistent between resources. The UMLS provides intermediate concepts through which other resources can be mapped, but these mappings suffer from the same challenges: they are not guaranteed to be one-to-one, especially in areas with evolving disease concepts such as rare disease.\r\n\r\nIn order to address the lack of a unified disease terminology that provides precise equivalences between disease concepts, we created Mondo, which provides a logic-based structure for unifying multiple disease resources.\r\n\r\nMondo’s development is coordinated with the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), which describes the individual phenotypic features that constitute a disease. Like the HPO, Mondo provides a hierarchical structure which can be used for classification or “rolling up” diseases to higher level groupings. It provides mappings to other disease resources, but in contrast to other mappings between ontologies, we precisely annotate each mapping using strict semantics, so that we know when two disease names or identifiers are equivalent or one-to-one, in contrast to simply being closely related.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see [https://mondo.monarchinitiative.org/](https://mondo.monarchinitiative.org/)",

Playbook aims to provide a standard system for naming radiology procedures, based on the elements which define an imaging exam such as modality and body part. By providing standard names and codes for radiologic studies, Playbook is intended to facilitate a variety of operational and quality improvement efforts, including workflow optimization, chargemaster management, radiation dose tracking, enterprise integration and image exchange.\r\n\r\nAs of RadLex Playbook version 2.5, a four-year project to harmonize RadLex Playbook with the radiology portion of the LOINC standard has been concluded, leading to the LOINC-RSNA Radiology Playbook which is jointly managed by the Regenstrief Institute (publisher of LOINC) and RSNA. This harmonized Playbook defines a new information model for describing imaging procedures, and identifies correspondences between RadLex Playbook codes and LOINC codes. (See https://loinc.org/download/loinc-users-guide and http://pubs.rsna.org/doi/pdf/10.1148/rg.2017160188 for details.) Note that RadLex Playbook codes start with \"RPID\" followed by a numerical value. LOINC codes consist of a numerical code, followed by a hyphen and a single additional digit (called the check digit). Note that in the future, new codes will be created in the LOINC format only, not the RPID format. New adopters are encouraged to use LOINC-format codes.\r\n\r\nLOINC-format codes may be accessed at http://search.loinc.org. New code requests may be submitted to the joint Regenstrief-RSNA governance committee at https://loinc.org/submissions/. \r\n\r\nFrom the RSNA website:\r\n\r\n\"We (RSNA) recognize the benefits that come from radiologists using common language to communicate diagnostic results. For this reason, RSNA produced RadLex®, a comprehensive set of radiology terms for use in radiology reporting, decision support, data mining, data registries, education and research.\r\n\r\nRadLex provides the foundation for vital data resources used in radiology:\r\n\r\n *  The LOINC/RSNA Radiology Playbook (http://playbook.radlex.org/playbook/SearchRadlexAction) \r\n *  RadElement Common Data Elements (http://www.radelement.org/) \r\n *  RadReport Radiology Reporting Templates (http://radreport.org/) \r\n\r\nThe development of RadLex has been supported by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) and the cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG) project.;\"",

Within each major category is a hierarchy reflecting both the clinical severity of the condition and its expected effect on future costs. Each of the hierarchical CDPS Categories is assigned a CDPS weight. CDPS weights are additive across major categories.\"\r\n\r\n\"The CDPS model was developed in 2000 using data from seven Fee-for-Service (FFS) Medicaid programs.  The model received major updates in 2009 (using national FFS Medicaid data from 2002-2005) and in 2014 (using additional national FFS Medicaid data from 2011). CDPS has also received regular annual updates to include the most recent ICD and NDC codes.\"\r\n\r\nFor more information, please visit [https://hwsph.ucsd.edu/research/programs-groups/cdps.html](https://hwsph.ucsd.edu/research/programs-groups/cdps.html)."

      "description" : "Starting in 2006, with the implementation of the Part D program, CMS introduced a second major HCC-based risk adjustment model. Created with the passage of the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003, the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug benefit became the second major Medicare capitated payment system. CMS developed the Part D RxHCC risk adjustment model to apply to monthly capitated payments to both Medicare Advantage (MA-PDs) and standalone prescription drug plans (PDPs). The Part D RxHCC risk adjustment model implemented in 2006 was developed using a structure similar to the CMS-HCC model, in that it included demographic and diagnosis information clustered into hierarchical condition categories. CMS obtains diagnoses for all Medicare beneficiaries from either fee-for-service claims or Medicare Advantage reporting. In 2011, CMS implemented an updated Part D RxHCC risk adjustment model, incorporating program data derived from prescription drug event (PDE) data. The data used to calibrate this updated model was more recent cost and utilization data, resulting in a model that reflects more recent drug cost and utilization patterns.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Health-Plans/MedicareAdvtgSpecRateStats/Risk-Adjustors\r\n\r\nThe CMS RxHCCs are in the public domain and are free to use without restriction."

It is designed to accommodate payments in multiple categories that are made by a single payer, as well as single provider organizations that receive payments in different categories—potentially from the same payer.\"\r\n\r\n   \"Since the original APM Framework White Paper was released in January 2016, it has become the foundation for implementing APMs and evaluating progress toward health care payment reform. Payers, providers, and purchasers have all used the APM Framework to better understand the payment reform landscape and to set goals for participation in APMs, and health care stakeholders have used the APM Framework to identify common goals for transforming the nation’s health care system. Overall, the APM Framework’s classification system has been adopted by the health care ecosystem.\"\r\n\r\n   \"The LAN APM Framework represents a continuum of payment approaches across four Categories.\"\r\n\r\n  Initial version of the APM Framework White Paper was published in 2016. The updated version of the White Paper was published in 2017.\r\n\r\n  For more information, please see [https://hcp-lan.org/workproducts/apm-refresh-whitepaper-final.pdf](https://hcp-lan.org/workproducts/apm-refresh-whitepaper-final.pdf)"

Annex A specifies the methodology for and structure of the RDD Dictionary, and specifies how further Terms may be defined under the governance of a Registration Authority, requirements for which are described in Annex C.\r\n\r\nTaken together, these specifications and the RDD Dictionary and Database make up the RDD System. Use of the RDD System will facilitate the accurate exchange and processing of information between interested parties involved in the administration of rights in, and use of, Digital Items, and in particular it is intended to support ISO/IEC 21000-5 (REL). Clause 6 describes how ISO/IEC 21000-6:2004 relates to ISO/IEC 21000-5.\r\n\r\nAs well as providing definitions of terms for use in ISO/IEC 21000-5, the RDD System is designed to support the mapping of terms from different namespaces. Such mapping will enable the transformation of metadata from the terminology of one namespace (or Authority) into that of another namespace. Mapping, to ensure minimum ambiguity or loss of semantic integrity, will be the responsibility of the Registration Authority. Provision of automated trm look-up is also a requirement.\r\n\r\nThe RDD Dictionary is a prescriptive dctionary, in the sense that it defines a single meaning for a trm represented by a particular RddAuthorized TermName, but it is also inclusive in that it can recognize the prescription of other Headwords and definitions by other Authorities and incorporates them through mappings. The RDD Dictionary also supports the circumstance that the same name may have different meanings under different Authorities. ISO/IEC 21000-6:2004describes audit provisions so that additions, amendments and deletions to Terms and their attributes can be tracked.\r\n\r\nISO/IEC 21000-6:2004 recognizes legal definitions as and only as Terms from other Authorities that can be mapped into the RDD Dictionary. Therefore Terms that are directly authorized by the RDD Registration Authority neither define nor prescribe intellectual property rights or other legal entities.",

The language identifiers according to this part of ISO 639 were devised originally for use in terminology, lexicography and linguistics, but may be adopted for any application requiring the expression of language in two- letter coded form, especially in computerized systems. The alpha-2 code was devised for practical use for most of the major languages of the world that are not only most frequently represented in the total body of the world's literature, but which also comprise a considerable volume of specialized languages and terminologies. Additional language identifiers are created when it becomes apparent that a significant body of documentation written in specialized languages and terminologies exists.

For example, the symptom of \"difficulty breathing\" is placed in the terminological hierarchy as a subsidiary (or \"child\") finding of \"pulmonary symptoms,\" although the presence (or absence) of difficulty breathing can related to conditions as diverse as myocardial infarction, bronchitis, pharyngeal foreign bodies, asthma, pulmonary embolism, etc. MEDCIN's diagnostic index provides more than 800 such links for difficulty breathing.",

The checkpointCode is specifies when the precondition is checked and is analogous to the various conditional statements and loop constructs in programming languages \"while-do\" vs. \"do-while\" or \"repeat-until\" vs. \"loop-exit\".\r\n\r\nFor all checkpointCodes, except \"end\", preconditions are being checked at the time when the preceding step of the plan has terminated and this step would be next in the sequence established by the sequenceNumber attribute.\r\n\r\nWhen the checkpointCode for a criterion of a repeatable Act is \"end\", the criterion is tested only at the end of each repetition of that Act. When the condition holds true, the next repetition is ready for execution.\r\n\r\nWhen the checkpointCode is \"entry\" the criterion is checked at the beginning of each repetition (if any) whereas \"beginning\" means the criterion is checked only once before the repetition \"loop\" starts.\r\n\r\nThe checkpointCode \"through\" is special in that it requires the condition to hold throughout the execution of the Act, even throughout a single execution. As soon as the condition turns false, the Act should receive an interrupt event (see interruptibleInd) and will eventually terminate.\r\n\r\nThe checkpointCode \"exit\" is only used on a special plan step that represents a loop exit step. This allows an action plan to exit due to a condition tested inside the execution of this plan. Such exit criteria are sequenced with the other plan components using the ActRelationship.sequenceNumber.",

The federal standards do not conceptually define ethnicity, and they recognize the absence of an anthropological or scientific basis for ethnicity classification. Instead, the federal standards acknowledge that ethnicity is a social-political construct in which an individual's own identification with a particular ethnicity is preferred to observer identification. The standards specify two minimum ethnicity categories: Hispanic or Latino, and Not Hispanic or Latino. The standards define a Hispanic or Latino as a person of \"Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, South or Central America, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race.\" The standards stipulate that ethnicity data need not be limited to the two minimum categories, but any expansion must be collapsible to those categories.

It should no longer be used. https://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem-CDCREC.html should be used in its place. In the United States, federal standards for classifying data on race determine the categories used by federal agencies and exert a strong influence on categorization by state and local agencies and private sector organizations. The federal standards do not conceptually define race, and they recognize the absence of an anthropological or scientific basis for racial classification. Instead, the federal standards acknowledge that race is a social-political construct in which an individual's own identification with one more race categories is preferred to observer identification. The standards use a variety of features to define five minimum race categories. Among these features are descent from \"the original peoples\" of a specified region or nation. The minimum race categories are American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White. The federal standards stipulate that race data need not be limited to the five minimum categories, but any expansion must be collapsible to those categories.",

The legislation included a requirement that the New York State Department of Health (NYDH) evaluate the applicability of the DRGs to a non-Medicare population. In particular, the legislation required that the DRGs be evaluated with respect to neonates and patients with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infections. NYDH entered into an agreement with 3M HIS to assist with the evaluation of the need for DRG modifications as well as to make the necessary changes in the DRG definitions and software. The DRG definitions developed by NYDH and 3M HIS are referred to as the All Patient DRGs (AP DRGs)."

      "description" : "3M APR DRGs have become the standard across the U.S. for classifying hospital inpatients in non-Medicare populations. As of January 2019, 27 state Medicaid programs use 3M APR DRGs to pay hospitals, as do approximately a dozen commercial payers and Medicaid managed care organizations. Over 2,400 hospitals have licensed 3M APR DRGs to verify payment and analyze their internal operations.\r\n\r\nThe 3M APR DRG methodology classifies hospital inpatients according to their reason for admission, severity of illness and risk of mortality.\r\n\r\nEach year 3M calculates and releases a set of statistics for each 3M APR DRG based on our analysis of large national data sets. These statistics include a relative weight for each 3M APR DRG. The relative weight reflects the average hospital resource use for a patient in that 3M APR DRG relative to the average hospital resource use of all inpatients. Please note that payers and other users of the 3M APR DRG methodology are responsible for ensuring that they use relative weights that are appropriate for their particular populations. The 3M APR DRG statistics also include data for each 3M APR DRG on relative frequency, average length of stay, average charges and incidence of mortality.\r\n\r\n3M APR DRGs can be rolled up into broader categories. The 326 base DRGs roll up into 25 major diagnostic categories (MDCs) plus a pre-MDC category. An example is MDC 04, Diseases and Disorders of the Respiratory System. As well, each 3M APR DRG is assigned to a service line that is consistent with the outpatient service lines that are defined by the 3M™  Enhanced Ambulatory Patient Groups (EAPGs)."

This system of terminology is the most widely accepted medical nomenclature used to report medical procedures and services under public and private health insurance programs. CPT coding is also used for administrative management purposes such as claims processing and developing guidelines for medical care review. Each year, via a rigorous, evidence-based and transparent process, the independent CPT Editorial Panel revises, creates or deletes hundreds of codes in order to reflect current medical practice.\r\n\r\nDesignated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) as a national coding set for physician and other health care professional services and procedures, CPT’s evidence-based codes accurately encompass the full range of health care services.\r\n\r\nAll CPT codes are five-digits and can be either numeric or alphanumeric, depending on the category. CPT code descriptors are clinically focused and utilize common standards so that a diverse set of users can have common understanding across the clinical health care paradigm.\r\n\r\nThere are various types of CPT codes:\r\n\r\nCategory I: These codes have descriptors that correspond to a procedure or service. Codes range from 00100–99499 and are generally ordered into sub-categories based on procedure/service type and anatomy.\r\n\r\nCategory II: These alphanumeric tracking codes are supplemental codes used for performance measurement. Using them is optional and not required for correct coding.\r\n\r\nCategory III: These are temporary alphanumeric codes for new and developing technology, procedures and services. They were created for data collection, assessment and in some instances, payment of new services and procedures that currently don’t meet the criteria for a Category I code.\r\n\r\nProprietary Laboratory Analyses (PLA) codes: These codes describe proprietary clinical laboratory analyses and can be either provided by a single (“solesource”) laboratory or licensed or marketed to multiple providing laboratories that are cleared or approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)). This category includes but is not limited to Advanced Diagnostic Laboratory Tests (ADLTs) and Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory Tests (CDLTs), as defined under the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA).",

      "description" : "In collaboration with NCBI, the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) is developing the Locus Reference Genomic Sequences (LRG) database, which is a database of reference sequences.\r\n\r\nLRG is a system for providing a genomic DNA sequence representation of a single gene that is idealized, has a permanent ID (with no versioning), and core content that never changes. LRG is not a nomenclature system. More than one LRG could be created for a region of interest, should that need arise. Additional annotations will be present that may change with time (each item carrying its own date stamp), so that the latest ancillary knowledge about a gene is directly available. In other words, an LRG sequence and its core annotation are not meant to represent current biology knowledge, but to provide a standard for reporting variation in a stable coordinate system. The combination of the LRG plus the updatable-annotation layer will be used to support the biological interpretation of variants.\r\n\r\nLRG identifiers can be used with the HL7 coded data type (code data type that accepts expression data, or a coded expression data type). This coded data type will be gene symbols can be used with the HL7 coded data type. For example, in the HL7 messages specified according to the HL7 V2 Clinical Genomics Fully LOINC-Qualified Genetic Variation Model, LRG identifiers can be used to as the observation values for Genomic Reference Sequence Identifier (LOINC code: 48013-7).\r\n\r\nLRG is a database that can be used freely by the public.",

      "description" : "ClinVar is a freely accessible, public archive of reports of the relationships among human variations and phenotypes, with supporting evidence. ClinVar thus facilitates access to and communication about the relationships asserted between human variation and observed health status, and the history of that interpretation. ClinVar processes submissions reporting variants found in patient samples, assertions made regarding their clinical significance, information about the submitter, and other supporting data. The alleles described in submissions are mapped to reference sequences, and reported according to the HGVS standard. ClinVar then presents the data for interactive users as well as those wishing to use ClinVar in daily workflows and other local applications. ClinVar works in collaboration with interested organizations to meet the needs of the medical genetics community as efficiently and effectively as possible. Read more about using ClinVar.\r\n\r\nClinVar supports submissions of differing levels of complexity. The submission may be as simple as a representation of an allele and its interpretation (sometimes termed a variant-level submission), or as detailed as providing multiple types of structured observational (case-level) or experimental evidence about the effect of the variation on phenotype. A major goal is to support computational (re)evaluation, both of genotypes and assertions, and to enable the ongoing evolution and development of knowledge regarding variations and associated phenotypes. ClinVar is an active partner of the ClinGen project, providing data for evaluation and archiving the results of interpretation by recognized expert panels and providers of practice guidelines (see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/review_guidelines/). ClinVar archives and versions submissions which means that when submitters update their records, the previous version is retained for review. Read more about submitting data to ClinVar at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/submit. \r\n\r\nThe level of confidence in the accuracy of variation calls and assertions of clinical significance depends in large part on the supporting evidence, so this information, when available, is collected and visible to users. Because the availability of supporting evidence may vary, particularly in regard to retrospective data aggregated from published literature, the archive accepts submissions from multiple groups, and aggregates related information, to reflect transparently both consensus and conflicting assertions of clinical significance. A review status is also assigned to any assertion, to support communication about the trustworthiness of any assertion. Domain experts are encouraged to apply for recognition as an expert panel (more info at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/review_guidelines/). \r\n\r\nAccessions, with the format SCV000000000.0, are assigned to each submitted record. If there are multiple submitted records about the same variation/condition pair, they are aggregated within ClinVar's data flow and reported as a reference accession with the format RCV000000000.0. Because of this model, one variant will be included in multiple RCV accessions whenever different conditions are reported for that variant. Submitted records for the same variation are also aggregated and reported as an accession with the format VCV000000000.0. This aggregation lets a user review all submitted data for a variant, regardless of the condition for which it was interpreted.\r\n\r\nClinVar archives submitted information, and adds identifiers and other data that may be available about a variant or condition from other public resources. However ClinVar neither curates content nor modifies interpretations independent of an explicit submission. If you have data that differs from what is currently represented in ClinVar, we encourage you to submit your data and the evidence supporting your interpretation. There is a submission wizard to guide you through that process. See https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/variation/clinvar_single_wizard/. \r\n\r\nIf you are submitting variants that were interpreted as part of work funded by the NIH, please consult your program officer about expectations for submissions to ClinVar."

Therefore, under the IPPS, we[CMS] pay for inpatient hospital services on a rate per discharge basis that varies according to the DRG to which a beneficiary's stay is assigned. The formula used to calculate payment for a specific case multiplies an individual hospital's payment rate per case by the weight of the DRG to which the case is assigned.  Each DRG weight represents the average resources required to care for cases in that particular DRG, relative to the average resources used to treat cases in all DRGs. Congress recognized that it would be necessary to recalculate the DRG relative weights periodically to account for changes in resource consumption.  Accordingly, section 1886(d)(4)(C) of the Act requires that the Secretary adjust the DRG classifications and relative weights at least annually.  These adjustments are made to reflect changes in treatment patterns, technology, and any other factors that may change the relative use of hospital resources.\r\n\r\nCurrently, cases are classified into Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groups (MS-DRGs) for payment under the IPPS based on the following information reported by the hospital: the principal diagnosis, up to 25 additional diagnoses, and up to 25 procedures performed during the stay.  In a small number of MS-DRGs, classification is also based on the age, sex, and discharge status of the patient.  Effective October 1, 2015, the diagnosis and procedure information is reported by the hospital using codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) and the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS).\r\n\r\nContent can be obtained on the CMS hosted page located at https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/AcuteInpatientPPS/MS-DRG-Classifications-and-Software \r\n\r\nThe DRGs are released annually with errata published infrequently. The fiscal year and release version should be noted (e.g., 2021.38.R1).\r\n\r\nRequests for annual MS-DRG classification changes and any MS-DRG related inquiries should be sent to the MSDRGClassificationChange@cms.hhs.gov mailbox.\r\n\r\nFor additional information on the MS-DRG system, including yearly reviews and changes to the MS-DRGs, please view prior Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) proposed and final rules located in the left navigational area of https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/AcuteInpatientPPS/MS-DRG-Classifications-and-Software"

      "description" : "\"Health Insurance Prospective Payment System (HIPPS) rate codes represent specific sets of patient characteristics (or case-mix groups) health insurers use to make payment determinations under several prospective payment systems. Case-mix groups are developed based on research into utilization patterns among various provider types. For the payment systems that use HIPPS codes, clinical assessment data is the basic input. A standard patient assessment instrument is interpreted by case-mix grouping software algorithms, which assign the case mix group. For payment purposes, at least one HIPPS code is defined to represent each case-mix group. These HIPPS codes are reported on claims to insurers.\r\n\r\nInstitutional providers use HIPPS codes on claims in association with special revenue codes. One revenue code is defined for each prospective payment system that requires HIPPS codes. HIPPS codes are placed in data element SV202 on the electronic 837 institutional claims transaction, using an HP qualifier, or in Form Locator (FL) 44 (\"HCPCS/rate\") on a paper UB-04 claims form. The associated revenue code is placed in data element SV201 or in FL 42. In certain circumstances, multiple HIPPS codes may appear on separate lines of a single claim.\"\r\n\r\n\"HIPPS codes are alpha-numeric codes of five digits. Each code contains intelligence, with certain positions of the code indicating the case mix group itself, and other positions providing additional information. The additional information varies among HIPPS codes pertaining to different payment systems, but often provides information about the clinical assessment used to arrive at the code. Which positions of the code carry the case mix group information may also vary by payment systems.\"\r\n\r\n\"Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) rules for transactions and code sets, HIPPS codes are defined as a non-medical code set. Therefore, these codes are effective by transaction date.\r\n\r\nEffective From Dates: HIPPS codes are valid under HIPAA on transactions on or after this date. Since all HIPPS codes to date have been initially created for Original Medicare payment systems, this is also date of service the codes begin to be payable by Medicare. While it is valid under HIPAA rules that a claim for dates of service before this date could be submitted on a transaction after this date, CMS is not aware of a business need for a provider to do so. The code would not be payable by any insurer and no Grouper software would be available to produce a code for those dates.\r\n\r\nEffective Through Dates: HIPPS codes are no longer valid under HIPAA on transactions on or after this date. This date may vary from the date a code ceases to be payable by Medicare, since other payers may continue to use older HIPPS codes after Medicare transitions to a new payment system. Since CMS, as the HIPPS code set maintainer, may not have complete information about other payers’ uses of these codes, codes may remain effective under HIPAA long after they cease to be payable on Medicare claims. To reflect this, a separate column on the HIPPS Code Master List indicates the Medicare Payment Though Date.\""
