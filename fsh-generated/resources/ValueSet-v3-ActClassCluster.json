The data might need to be represented as a nested set of values, as a table, list, or as a time series. The Cluster class permits such aggregation within an entry for such compound data.\n\nExamples include \"Haematology investigations\" which might include two or more distinct batteries.\n\nA cluster may contain batteries and/or individual entries",
