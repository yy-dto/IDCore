The underwriter of that policy is the scoping entity.\n\n*Discussion:*The identifier of the policy is captured in 'Role.id' when the Role is a policy holder.\n\nA particular policy may cover several individuals one of whom may be, but need not be, the policy holder. Thus the notion of covered party is a role that is distinct from that of the policy holder.",
