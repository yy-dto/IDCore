Examples of greater access than is normally accessible by providers based on the need to know are access to sensitive information for which access typically requires a patient's consent. This is not an override of a patient's dissent to disclose sensitive information in cases where the applicable policy waives the need for that consent to access this information. In US, Title 38 Section 7332 and 42 CFR Part 2 both permit emergency access without the need to override a patient's consent directive; rather, this access is a limitation to the patient's right to dissent from disclosure.\r\n\r\nThere is a semantic gap in concepts.
