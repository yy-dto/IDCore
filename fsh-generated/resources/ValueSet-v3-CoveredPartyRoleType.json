  "description": "A role recognized through the eligibility of an identified living subject for benefits covered under an insurance policy or a program. Eligibility as a covered party may be conditioned on a relationship with (1) the policy holder such as the policy holder who is covered as an individual under a poliy or as a party sponsored for coverage by the policy holder.\n\n**Example:**An employee as a subscriber; or (2) on being scoped another covered party such as the subscriber, as in the case of a dependent.\n\n**Discussion:** The Abstract Value Set \"CoverageRoleType\", which was developed for use in the Canadian realm \"pre-coordinate\" coverage roles with other roles that a covered party must play in order to be eligible for coverage, e.g., \"handicapped dependent\". Other codes in the Abstract Value Set CoveredPartyRoleType domain can be \"post-coordinated\" with the EligiblePartyRoleType codes to denote comparable concepts. Decoupling the concepts is intended to support a wider range of concepts and semantic comparability of coded concepts.",
